# My Familiar
Spring 2020 is a strange time. Pestilence and pandemic ravage the globe and millions of lives have been dramatically altered due to the strict quarantine protocols.
It has been weeks --nay months, since people have been able to see thier friends
and families. When will we be able to go out and see our loved ones? To once again
gather in groups?

Enter My Familiar, a RPG character generator that allows the user to create player characters and NPCs that are compatible with most d20 RPGs. This web application was developed with the purpose of transporting the currently quarantined masses to far off lands and imagining themselves interacting with all sorts of creatures and characters. My Familiar uses the Bootstrap framework to provide a professional and fantastic feel, while implementing the parallax feature for an more elevated aesthetic. 

# Installation
npm i

# Usage
From the Log In page, the user is prompted with the option of logging in with a registered username or given the option to create an account. From here, new users can opt to create a new character or browse and access previously generated characters, which are stored in a MySQL database by a user ID. 

If the user opts to create a new character, they are taken to a character sheet template where they can input character stats, personality traits, weapons, spells, and more.
